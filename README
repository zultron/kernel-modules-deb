These are add-on modules for the Debian kernel.

They work with the kernel-package.

To use them, place the contents of this directory in /usr/src/modules,
or else set the MODULE_LOC environment variable to this directory.

Then in a make-kpkg style kernel source tree, run

    make-kpkg modules_image

or maybe

    debian/rules modules_image

This will create kernel module packages in the parent directory.
